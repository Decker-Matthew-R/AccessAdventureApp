### Product Backlog
<br>
<br>
Our product backlog is ordered in a way that represents the flow of the app. First, users must view the sign-up page and create a login page. From their, our backlog items flow as a user would use the app. At the bottom of our backlog items, we have included features that aren't essential for an MVP, but features we hope to be able to include if time permits.
<br>
<br>

1. As a user I want to create my sign-up page so that I can create my profile.
2. As a user I want to log in with my user name and password so that I can get into my page.
<br>
3. As a user I want to have the option to set up my profile so that I can update my information.  
<br>
4. As a user I want this application to be enabled on my IOS and Android devices so that I can check my profile from any devices.  
<br>
5. As a user I want to have the options to chat with friends so that I can chat with my friends when available. 
<br>
6. As a user I want to have my current location set as default location so that I can pinpoint where I am looking my match.  
<br>
7. As a user I want my personal information to be secure so that my information won't leak. 
<br>
8. As a user I want to have log out functionality activated so that I can securely log out from my app.
<br>
9. As a user I want the ability to retrieve or reset a password so I will be able to access my account if I forget the password.  
<br>
10. As a user I want to have the ability to delete the profile so that I can delete my profile when needed.  
<br>
11. As a user, I want to have my account activated with face ID and fingerprint.
<br>
12. As a user I want to have a separate database created so that all the users information are kept separate and secure.  
<br>
13. As a user I want to have log out functionality activated so that I can securely log out from my app. As a user I want to link my profile to my social media apps so that I can access the updates soon.
